                        <h2>THE FASTEST GROWING CAKE BAKERY CONCEPT IN NIGERIA</h2>
                        <p>
                            THECAKE started in 1980 in Australia as a family run business called Bakers Delight. There are now over 700 Bakers Delight locations in Australia and New Zealand.  THECAKE has been built on this success and experience with over 150 bakeries in NIGERIA, and plans to grow by an estimated 15 bakeries per year for the next several years.
                            
                            Our franchisees use the strength of a nationally recognized brand to grow their businesses and give back to the community. We’ve proudly donated over $300 million in unsold products to local charities since 2003.
